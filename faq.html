      <h4>Why did you join?</h4>
      <p>Every cadet joins ROTC for their own reasons. Some join because they wanted to fly in the world's greatest air force, some join because they are looking to be apart of something greater than themselves, whatever reason it may be, they joined because they wanted to. Being apart of ROTC has to be a task that you want to take on, not one that was forced upon you.</p>

      <h4>Do I need a certain GPA to join?</h4>
      <p>Yes, you must maintain a 2.0 GPA to be in ROTC</p>

      <h4>What are the time requirements for ROTC?</h4>
      <p>Every cadet must attend 80% of all practical military training sessions, they must attend a summer field training session the summer between their sophomore and junior year, and to receive a commission must graduate with a four-year bachelor's degree. </p>

      <h4>How hard is ROTC?</h4>
      <p>There are different challenges for each cadet. The level of difficulty is different for everyone.</p>

      <h4>Do you need to wear a uniform?</h4>
      <p>Yes. During your GMC years, freshmen and sophomore year of college, students typically wear PTGs, once earned, during physical training sessions, and the alternate uniform during leadership laboratory and the aerospace studies class. During their POC years, junior and senior years, cadets will wear their PTGs during physical training sessions and either short-sleeve blues or the airman battle uniform for leadership laboratory and aerospace studies classes.</p>

      <h4>What happens after you graduate?</h4>
      <p>Following graduation, you will commission as a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force.</p>

      <h4>When will you receive your job?</h4>
      <p>Typically, cadets will receive their AFSCs their fall semester of their senior year.</p>

      <h4>Can you receive a scholarship in college?</h4>
      <p>Yes, there are several scholarships given out to deserving cadets during their freshmen or sophomore year in school.</p>

      <h4>Do you have to transfer to a four-year institution?</h4>
      <p>All cadets are required to receive a four-year degree. Some community colleges or two-year institutions have that option within their educational program, however, if it is not an option, cadets will need to transfer to complete their studies.</p>

      <h4>Are you deploying?</h4>
      <p>No, all cadets live a normal college student life. We encourage our students to be well rounded and involved in several extra-curricular activities.</p>
